# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA
I collaborated with UNP Education to analyze a company's financial data using Power BI. The project focuses on sales performance, profit margins, discount impact, and segment analysis. I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to develop interactive dashboards with key insights. The visuals include KPI indicators, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for financial tracking. The analysis identifies top-selling products, high-profit segments, and discount trends. This repository contains Power BI reports (.pbix), dataset files, and documentation explaining the process.
