# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA
I worked with UNP Education on this project to analyze a company's financial dataset using Power BI. The focus areas include sales trends, profit margins, discount effects, and segment performance. I handled data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to build interactive dashboards with key insights. The dashboards feature KPI indicators, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to track financial performance. The analysis highlights top-selling products, profitable segments, and the impact of discounts on margins. This repository includes Power BI reports (.pbix), dataset files, and projectÂ documentation.
